# A Creative Technologist from Buenos Aires, Argentina.
This is a portfolio of *lateral* mostly creative projects I've been involved with. On my non-lateral career I have founded two companies which basically portray my two biggest passions; [+OTROS](http://masotros.com/) which is an studio that creates technological experiences for brands and [Cran.io](http://cran.io/) which is a software and hardware development boutique for startups. I have also worked for projects like [Count.it](http://countit.com.ar) and [Betrack](http://betrack.co). I hold a degree in Electronic Engineer from ITBA.

Thanks for stopping by!
