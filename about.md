# A Creative Technologist from Buenos Aires, Argentina.
This is a *lateral* portfolio that includes a selection of mostly creative projects I've either developed or directed. On my non-lateral career I have founded two companies which basically portray my two biggest passions; [+OTROS](https://www.linkedin.com/company/masotros/) which is an studio that creates technological experiences for brands and [Cran.io](http://cran-io.github.io/) which is a software and hardware development boutique for startups. I hold a degree in Electronic Engineer from ITBA. Check out my full CV in [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jvelazqueztraut).

Thanks for all the fish!
