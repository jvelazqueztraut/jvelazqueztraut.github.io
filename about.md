## Creative Technologist from Buenos Aires, Argentina

This is a *lateral* portfolio that includes a selection of mostly creative projects I've either developed or directed. On my non-lateral career I have started two companies ([+OTROS](https://vimeo.com/1136143168){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} was a studio that created technological experiences for brands and [Cran.io](http://cran-io.github.io/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} was a software and hardware development company) and have worked for both startups and big-tech in development, consulting and management roles. I hold a degree in Electronic Engineer from ITBA. Check out my full CV on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jvelazqueztraut).

Thanks for all the fish!
