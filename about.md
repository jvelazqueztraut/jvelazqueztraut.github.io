# A Creative Technologist from Buenos Aires, Argentina.
I hold a degree in Electronic Engineer from ITBA. I have founded two companies which basically portray my two biggest passions; [+OTROS](http://masotros.com/) which is an studio that creates technological experiences for brands and [Cran.io](http://cran.io/) which is a software and hardware development boutique for startups.
This is my personal portfolio, thanks for stopping by!
