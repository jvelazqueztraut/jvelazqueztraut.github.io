Excited to announce that I’ve started advising [**Zonia**](https://www.zoniamusic.com), a pioneering platform tailored to **Latin-american emerging musical artists**. Zonia bridges the gap between artists and their fans, offering a subscription-based model where fans can access exclusive content while supporting their favorite creators.  


The platform has already **built a thriving community** of artists and fans, recently launching their **online platform**. This ecosystem enables musicians to focus on their craft while generating revenue — a game-changer for new talent in a highly competitive industry.

In my advisory capacity, I contribute by:  
- **Defining Technological Strategy**: Guiding Zonia’s tech roadmap to ensure scalability and user-centric development.  
- **Shaping Investment Strategy**: Helping align their technological growth with smart, sustainable investment opportunities.

I’m thrilled to collaborate with Zonia’s passionate team and contribute to a movement that reshapes how we support emerging artists. Stay tuned for more updates!
