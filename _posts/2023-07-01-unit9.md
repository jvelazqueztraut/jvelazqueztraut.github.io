Excited to share that I stepped into the role of **Tech Lead AR/VR** at [UNIT9](https://www.unit9.com){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. UNIT9 has long been a playground for boundary-pushing interactive productions, and now I get to co-create immersive experiences with their award-winning teams.

Highlights from the new chapter:

- **Leading prototypes and production builds** that merge real-time 3D, game engines, and spatial storytelling.
- **Partnering with directors, creatives, and producers** to translate ambitious concepts into deployable interactive experiences.
- **Scaling AR/VR toolkits** that support rapid experimentation across campaigns and experiential activations.

Looking forward to crafting reality-bending stories with UNIT9’s brilliant collaborators.
