As of 2022 I’ve joined Meta’s **Applied R&D** team, focusing on the business impact of AR/VR technologies. The group explores how immersive tools can unlock new value for enterprises and partners, and I’m all-in on helping companies navigate the path toward the metaverse.

What I’m diving into:

- **Designing proof-of-value pilots** that demonstrate how spatial computing can solve real operational problems.
- **Partnering with product, research, and go-to-market teams** to translate technical insights into actionable roadmaps.
- **Championing responsible adoption** by advising on metrics, training, and long-term investment in immersive capabilities.

It’s energizing to collaborate with Meta’s innovators and help businesses take confident strides into the next computing platform.
