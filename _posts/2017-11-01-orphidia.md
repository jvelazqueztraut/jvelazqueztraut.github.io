In late 2017 I joined [Orphidia](https://www.orphidia.com){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} as **Software Development Lead**, partnering with a multidisciplinary team building accessible diagnostics technology. The mission: make complex lab workflows available through portable devices.

Key areas of impact:

- **Architecting software systems** that power Orphidia’s microfluidics platform, from data acquisition to visualization.
- **Leading a lean engineering team** with agile processes tailored to regulated hardware and software development.
- **Collaborating with scientists and clinicians** to translate research breakthroughs into reliable, user-centered tools.

Proud to have contributed to Orphidia’s vision—and to carry forward lessons from health-tech innovation into future projects.
