I started teaching AR/VR at [Universidad de San Andr√©s](https://udesa.edu.ar/) in the Immersive Environments course which is part of the [Degree in Design](https://udesa.edu.ar/departamento-de-humanidades/licenciatura-en-diseno). First virtually, then in person. Typical class looks like the pictures below, either trying out classic 3D anaglyph glasses or experimenting with the latest VR headsets:
