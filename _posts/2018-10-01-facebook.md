Back in 2018 I joined Facebook as a **Solutions Engineer**, embedding with partner teams to bring new experiences to market. It was an incredible chance to operate at global scale while keeping a builder’s mindset.

During this chapter I focused on:

- **Designing and shipping technical integrations** that helped partners tap into Facebook’s platform capabilities.
- **Translating roadmap and product updates** into actionable guidance for developers and business stakeholders.
- **Championing experimentation** with prototypes that showed what was possible across AR, messaging, and commerce surfaces.

Grateful for the collaborations that shaped this period and set the stage for the immersive work that followed.
