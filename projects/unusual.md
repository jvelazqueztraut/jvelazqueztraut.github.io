Audio reactive sign for the [Unusual](https://www.instagram.com/unusual.london/) party in London.

Unusual happens every month in different locations across London. Its hosts wanted a light design that would help with brand recognition and could easily be installed and uninstalled on each event.

I designed and developed this hanging sign based on an ESP32 with a custom firmware at first that I then migrated to [WLED](https://kno.wled.ge/):

The LED strips are set up in the shape of the letters to allow for beautiful swirling effects per letter:
