Light design for [Juana Isola](https://www.instagram.com/juanaisola/)'s exhibition *Your Mind Is Your Playground* performed at Omega Works in London on October 2022.

Juana's exhibition consists of both live performance and video content so she asked me to design lighting that could shift the focus to where the action was taking place. The inspiration for the light artifacts was a homely kitchen.

The set designed by [Paula Baiguera](https://www.instagram.com/paulabaiguera/) featured loads of food which was really fun to light up in different colors.
