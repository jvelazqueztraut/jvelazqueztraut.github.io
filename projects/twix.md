Interactive web experience created for Twix's Super Bowl campaign, transforming the traditional ad break into an engaging second-screen staredown game. The project challenged viewers to maintain eye contact with a pair of golden Twix bars during commercial breaks, turning passive viewing into an active, gamified experience.

We developed a mobile-first interactive experience that leveraged computer vision to track user engagement:

- **Eye-Tracking Technology**: Using [Mediapipe](https://github.com/google-ai-edge/mediapipe), we created a precise eye-tracking system that monitored users' attention on the golden Twix bars.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Users received immediate visual feedback on their staring progress.
- **Super Bowl Sync**: Using a custom developed backend we managed to make the experience be in sync with the game's commercial breaks, maximizing engagement.

The results were impressive:

- **15,956 unique users played the game**
- **25 minutes average total staring time per user**
