Light design and interactive installation created in collaboration with artist [Solana Tixi](https://www.instagram.com/solanatixi/) for her exhibition "Que Me Vean Haciendo". Together, we transformed a simple gallery room into a surreal landscape that would keep visitors warm during the winter months of the exhibition.

I designed and built custom light artifacts using ESP32 microcontrollers, which allowed me to create dynamic and synchronized lighting effects. This technical setup gave us the flexibility to experiment with various lighting scenarios and find the perfect atmosphere for each part of the exhibition. Shadows!!!

The result was an immersive environment where the light and the absence of light became an integral part of the artistic experience.
