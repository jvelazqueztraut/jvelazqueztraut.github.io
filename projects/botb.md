Web AR experience developed to promote the historic boxing match between Tyson Fury and Francis Ngannou, one of the biggest events in the sport this decade. The website served as the central online hub for the fight, offering pre-fight hype and post-fight highlights.

This project featured a multi-mode Web AR experience with interactive and shareable content:

1. **Tabletop Mode**: Users could place 3D versions of the fighters in their surroundings, scale them down, and interact with them.

2. **Room Scale Mode**: Life-size projections of the fighters allowed users to experience their full scale up close.

3. **Sky Mode**: Fighters appeared at the size of buildings, recreating their iconic ring entrances.

Each AR experience encouraged user interaction, allowing for photos and videos to be shared on social media. The site also hosted two competitions: 
- A social media contest with a $50,000 prize for the best post.
- A prediction challenge where users could guess the fight's outcome to win $100,000.

The website was designed for both desktop and mobile devices to ensure accessibility.
Here are some visuals of the website on desktop:
