The Museum of the Book and Language from Buenos Aires exhibits the works of many writers and authors from Latin America. I developed an interactive installation that reacts to people walking by the side of the second-floor of the building. The projections on the wall show a universe of floating and rotating letters. Those letters get together and start forming a phrase when a person comes close to the wall. Every person gets a different phrase and that phrase follows them all around.

I used [Processing](http://processing.org/) for both the visuals and the tracking. The tracking was done using cameras in the ceiling. The visuals rendered a simple yet engaging 3D world with really cool camera-depth simulation.
Check out a video of the installation:
