Generative light installation exploring the complexity and beauty of light through three dynamic circular pieces. The work creates an immersive maze of light that invites visitors to experience and contemplate the fundamental properties of light: reflection, refraction, shadow, and dynamism.

The installation consists of three circular pieces that work together to create an intricate play of light. Each piece is carefully designed to interact with light in different ways, creating a complex network of reflections and shadows that constantly evolve. The dynamic nature of the pieces means that no two moments are exactly the same, encouraging visitors to spend time observing and discovering new patterns and interactions.

I was particularly interested in how light behaves in space and how we perceive it. The circular form was chosen for its ability to create continuous, flowing patterns, while the dynamic elements add an element of unpredictability and surprise. The result is a meditation on the nature of light itself - how it moves, how it interacts with surfaces, and how it shapes our perception of space.

The installation was first exhibited in my studio in Piso 29 on April 2025.
