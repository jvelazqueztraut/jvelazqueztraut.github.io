Generative art based on the sound of a drum! Co-developed with Alan Grizek. We installed pick-ups to each of the drum pieces to get a MIDI signal which we would then use to create generative paint brushes to imitate a Pollock-style:

This is the famous Zeta Bosio (drummer from Soda Stereo) playing in the installation:

It was installed in Personal Fest 2014. Many of the resulting artworks were printed and exhibited:
