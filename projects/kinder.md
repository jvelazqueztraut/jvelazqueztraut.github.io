I developed an interactive game for kids to be exhibited at the Feria del Libro 2013 for the brand Kinder. The kids entered the space and found themselves inside a *magical* world and could interact with the elements inside it!

It was developed using the Microsoft Kinect. Check out the coverage of a local TV channel on the installation (spanish):
