I developed interactive installations for the Ministry of Economy's stand in [Tecnópolis](http://www.tecnopolis.gob.ar) 2013. Tecnópolis is the biggest technology and science fair in Argentina. Most of the installations consisted of a gamified story showing many statistics and numbers of the economy in Argentina. Some of the screening took place on proper touch screens while other was based on projectors and mapping of tailor-made surfaces. This was accomplished using the Kinect as you can see in the video below:

The picture below shows an acrylic sculpture that was also touch-sensitive.

Other content was displayed on rear-projected screens and we used IR cameras to track the touch positions:

Some other content was just on awesome touch screen TVs:
