We were asked to design a space where kids could work together making music for the Tecn√≥polis 2012 exhibition. The project consisted of 12 netbooks with a *sequencer* interface that was synchronized altogether to form a Digital Orchestra.
Here are some renders of the first designs we came up for the space:

I made an interface using Processing for every kid to be able to chose which type of instruments they wanted to use. The instruments were chosen from specific regions from Argentina. The sequencer interface allowed them to easily add sounds to the sequence and compose their own rythms.
