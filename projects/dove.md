Interactive web experience created for Dove’s *Real Beauty DNA* campaign, extending their commitment to challenging unrealistic beauty standards. The project empowered users to define their own vision of Real Beauty while influencing Pinterest’s algorithm to promote natural, diverse, and authentic imagery.

We developed a mobile-first interactive experience that seamlessly integrated with Pinterest. The key features included:
- **Infinite Canvas of Real Beauty**: Users explored an endless scroll of diverse images – real people, natural imperfections, cultural moments, and landscapes.
- **Interactive Questions and Visuals**: Users answered thought-provoking questions to shape their personalized exploration.
- **Custom Video Generation**: A celebratory video showcased each user’s definition of Real Beauty, featuring their selected images.
- **Pinterest Integration**: With one click, users saved their curated selections directly to their Pinterest boards, influencing the algorithm to prioritize natural beauty.
