We constructed custom made LED tubes which have 60 leds per meter and can be controlled led by led (based on the WS2811). Using an Arduino and an Ethernet shield we controlled these tubes in real-time. We designed an interface in openFrameworks to work with all the tubes and came up with music-reactive sequences for every part of the song from the band.
Here are some pics of the making of:
