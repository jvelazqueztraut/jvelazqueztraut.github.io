Light design and AV show for [Clara Pinto](https://www.instagram.com/laclarapinto/)'s fashion show during London Craftweek 2022.

Together with a team of wonderful artists and designers ([@catalinajoy](https://www.instagram.com/catalinajoy/), [@kamolaaskarova](https://www.instagram.com/kamolaaskarova/)) we intervened the Argentinean Ambassadorâ€™s residence in London to convert it into a surreal landscape. From what you see on the left to what you see on the right:

Inspired by videogame visuals, our goal was to turn the runway into a playful journey with highlighted stops where the models would pause and reveal the designs. I built custom LED controllers based on ESP32 that run [WLED](https://kno.wled.ge/) and can be controlled over-the-air using Artnet DMX. The rest of the stage lights in the setup are also controlled in realtime using DMX. The software used to run the show was [Protopixel](https://www.protopixel.io/). Here are some pics of the final result:
