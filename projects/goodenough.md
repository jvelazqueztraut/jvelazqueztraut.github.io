Stage light design and visual show for [Guido Sirna aka GERDA](https://www.instagram.com/gerdamusic/)'s live set in Goodenough College London.

Scratch build of a set of 18 LED tubes to create stage visuals that danced to the music creating a multi-sensory experience and captivating atmosphere. The controllers are [QuinLED-Dig-Quad](https://quinled.info/quinled-dig-quad/) running [WLED](https://kno.wled.ge/). I created generative visuals for the tubes using [TouchDesigner](https://derivative.ca/) that get sent using [Protopixel](https://www.protopixel.io/) via Artnet DMX. Many, many tubes and many, many nodes:

The stage included multiple lights that can be controlled via DMX. Here is a pic of the final look of the stage with the LED tubes at the back:
