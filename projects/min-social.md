I developed an interactive installation for kids to be exhibited at the Youth Congress in San Juan, Argentina and organized by the Ministry of Development and Social Security. Kids could choose from many professions and then see themselves in the screen wearing clothes from that profession instantly! They could also print these pictures and take them home. This project was developed using a camera with lots of image processing and lots of face tracking and body tracking. Check out some pictures of the resulting new professionals that enjoyed the installation:
